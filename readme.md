## OpenAI-Streamlit app deployed on a Raspberry Pi 4
This streamlit multi-page webapp explores the different models from OpenAI API. In the first version of this streamlit app, 2 models ("gpt-3.5-turbo", "Dall-E2") are implemented along with a custom page showing the search history (server side) by parsing a local log file. I do this by storing the promts and responses obtained to a log file. For `Dall-E2`, I save the images locally from the response web url and then access them in the [3_ðŸ“‹_Search_History.py](https://github.com/jeev20/OpenAI-Streamlit-WebApp/blob/master/pages/3_ðŸ“‹_Search_History.py) page. The cool thing about the Search History is that it preserves the markdown syntax similar to the original response. This search pages allows me to quick look through past promts and avoid redundant promts (saving some token usage). 

## Usage
* Clone this repository 
* Set an enviornmental variable for the Open API key (see below how this is done)
* `CD` into the downloaded repository
* Create a virtual environment in the repository (i use virtualenv : `virtualenv env`)
* Activate your virtual environment `source env/bin/activate` on linux OR `.\env\Scripts\activate.ps1` on windows
* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` within your virtual environment
* Run `streamlit run .\OpenAI_Demos.py` a browser will be opened at `http://localhost:8501`

### Hosting

I host this app on a raspberrypi 4 which serves as my assistant. 

#### OpenVPN
By default this implementation will only be accessible on your network where the raspberrypi is connected. But that is not good enough. To make it accessible anywhere in the world, I use a OpenVPN solution (from my Asus Router). This  This first version was developed during my vacation in India and deployed on a raspberrypi back home in Norway. It is pretty cool to have access to your home network anywhere you go!

#### OpenAI API key as Enviornment variable
##### On Linux
To set the OpenAI API we can set an enviornment variable by navigating to `etc`. Here I use nano to open the `profile` contents. 
```bash
nano etc/profile
# at the end of the file add this 
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR OPENAI API KEY"
```
To check all the environment variable is set we use 
```bash
printenv
```
OR 
```bash
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
```
##### On windows
Remember that newly set enviornment variables are only accessible after a restart of windows. 

``Start menu --> Edit system enviornment variables --> Enviornment variables --> System variable --> Add``

`OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR OPENAI API KEY"`



### Bash script
Then we write a bash script with a tag `-l` which ensures enviornment variables are accessible when the script is run from crontab. 

The `source` and `streamlit run` both need the full path to their respective files. We finally save this file as `RunChatGPT.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash -l
# Let's call this script RunChatGPT.sh
source "home/raspi4/Dokumenter/ChatGPTIntegration/env/bin/activate"
streamlit run "home/raspi4/Dokumenter/ChatGPTIntegration/OpenAI_Demos.py"
```

#### Start on reboot
Ideally, we want our streamlit app to restart automatically after the raspberrypi reboots. We can do this by updating the crontab. To open crontab on nano use the following. 

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```
Add the following at the end of `crontab` file
``` bash
@reboot /home/raspi4/RunChatGPT.sh
```
This should then run streamlit when the raspberrypi reboots.

Thanks to folks at [Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) and [OpenAI](https://openai.com).

ChatGPT does improve troubleshooting and helps me be a better developer and I do like having access to this superpower. Thank you Streamlit for making it so easy to run such demos.
